# nvim_crossOS

A **cross-platform Neovim configuration** designed to run unmodified on
**Windows, WSL, and Linux**, with a strong focus on:

- predictable behavior across OSes
- explicit LSP configuration
- minimal magic
- readable Lua over clever Lua

This config is actively evolving and intentionally opinionated.

---

## ✨ Goals

- **Single config, multiple platforms**
  No OS-specific forks or manual edits.

- **Explicit over implicit**
  If something is enabled, it’s done deliberately.

- **LSP-first editing**
  Language servers, diagnostics, and tooling are configured carefully
  (and not blindly copy-pasted).

- **Noise-free diagnostics**
  `lua_ls` is tuned to be _useful_, not naggy.

- **Composable setup**
  Pieces are meant to be reused, replaced, or removed without collapse.

- **PowerShell (`PSES`)**
  Content around the `PowerShell` LSP was somewhat scarce or outdated when I started.
  I do most of my work in PowerShell, so these settings may be useful to others.

---

## 🖥 Supported Platforms

- Windows 11 (native Neovim)
- WSL (Ubuntu 22.04+)
- Native Ubuntu 22.04+

> The same config is expected to work on all of the above without modification.
> The bootstrap script has been tested on both WSL and native Ubuntu.
> Other Debian-based systems will likely work but are not guaranteed.

## 📦 Plugin Management

This configuration uses **[lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)**.

Plugins are:

- grouped by responsibility
- loaded lazily where possible
- configured in isolated modules

---

## 🧠 LSP Philosophy

- Capabilities are **constructed explicitly**
- Optional plugin APIs (e.g. `blink.cmp`) are guarded safely
- Dynamic Lua patterns are acknowledged where static analysis falls short
- Diagnostics are suppressed **only when justified**

If something looks verbose, it’s usually intentional.

## 🗂 Directory Layout (high level)

```text
lua/
├── config/
│   ├── lsp/
│   │   ├── capabilities.lua
│   │   ├── helpers.lua
│   │   └── semantic_cmp.lua
│   ├── diagnostics.lua
│   ├── keymaps.lua
│   ├── options.lua
│   └── lazy.lua
├── plugins/
│   ├── lsp.lua
│   ├── lua.lua
│   ├── lualine.lua
│   └── ...
└── types/
```

This may evolve, but the guiding rule is:

One file = one responsibility.

---

## ⚠️ Status

This is not a “finished” config, but everything here does work.

The setup is intentionally kept basic and lean, without every plugin I personally use,
but it should still be easy to extend or adapt without much friction.

This is a spare-time project, so active support should not be expected.

Expect:

- refactors
- occasional breaking changes (or long periods without updates)
- experiments
- rewrites when something becomes clearer

That’s by design.

## Installation (try-it-as-is)

This config assumes Neovim ≥ 0.10 and uses Lazy.nvim.

### Unix / WSL

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Masterkatt3n/nvim_crossOS ~/.config/nvim
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Masterkatt3n/nvim_crossOS $env:USERPROFILE\.config\nvim
```

- On first start, Lazy.nvim will install plugins automatically.

---

## 🔧 Optional: Full Clean WSL Build (LLVM + Ninja + Nightly Rust)

For users who want a fully reproducible Neovim build from source
(using LLVM 20, Ninja, Rust nightly, and a clean XDG state), a bootstrap script is provided:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-buildnvim.sh
```

### What it does

The script performs a deterministic rebuild of Neovim and its supporting toolchain.

It will:

- Ensure the `universe` repository is enabled

- Install `nala` (APT frontend)

- Perform a full system upgrade

- Install toolchains:
  - LLVM/clang (v20)
  - Rust (nightly default + stable fallback)
  - Node.js (LTS)

- Install native build dependencies (cmake, ninja, etc.)

- Install Cargo CLI tools:
  - `ripgrep`
  - `fd`
  - `ast-grep`
  - `stylua`
  - `tree-sitter-cli`

- Install `lazygit`

- Ensure `~/.cargo` and `~/.local/bin` are properly added to `PATH`

- Backs up existing `~/.config/nvim`

- Purges Neovim user state (`cache`, `data`, `config`)

- Clone this configuration repository
- Clone and build Neovim from source:
  - `RelWithDebInfo`
  - Ninja backend
  - LLVM toolchain
  - LLD linker

- Package and install Neovim as `.deb`

- Installs JetBrainsMono Nerd Font

- Installs PowerShell (`pwsh`)

- Installs optional Neovim Python and Node integrations

### ⚠️ Warning

This script:

- Performs a full system upgrade

- Removes previous Neovim installs

- Purges XDG Neovim directories

It is intended for:

- WSL Ubuntu environments (22.04+)

- Users who understand what a clean rebuild implies

- Reproducible dev setups

> The script is intentionally opinionated and not designed as a general-purpose installer.
>
> If you just want the configuration, cloning the repo is sufficient.
